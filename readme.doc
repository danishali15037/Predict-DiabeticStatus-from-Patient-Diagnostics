Predict Diabetic Status from Patient Diagnostics

In this project, I have built and trained a deep learning model using Python and Keras to
predict whether a patient is diabetic based on diagnostic measures.

Tools and Technologies Used
    Programming Language: Python
    Deep Learning Framework: Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
    Libraries:
    NumPy: For numerical computations
    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
    Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization
    Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing and model evaluation
    IDE: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
    
Why Keras?
    Keras is a beginner-friendly deep learning library that I used for creating neural networks. 
    It is part of the larger TensorFlow framework, allowing me to leverage its power in a simple 
    and intuitive way. By working with Keras, I also gained a foundational understanding of TensorFlow,
    which is essential for more advanced deep learning projects.

Project Highlights
In this project, I:

Developed my first neural network using Keras.
Achieved a prediction accuracy of 72% for identifying diabetic patients.
Explored methods to improve model performance, including:
Adding additional layers to the neural network.
Modifying activation functions.
Experimenting with different loss and optimization functions during model compilation.
Adjusting training parameters such as epochs and batch size.
Next plan
I plan to continue improving the modelâ€™s performance by applying advanced techniques, 
while ensuring that the model avoids overfitting and generalizes well on unseen data.
